Satellite Differential Equation
===============================
We consider a simple satellite dynamics with states
(r,rdot,th,thdot). 

Here the state variables are normalized with respect to radius of earth 
and orbit time.

Therefore, variable r=1 means 6378.1363 km, which is the radius of earth.
For a particular satellite, time is normalized by orbit time Tp.
Therefore, t=1 => 6300 s for the satellite considered in the simulations.
Angular variable th is unchanged.

The dynamics is defined in satelliteDynamics.m

This the simplest satellite model. Does not include any perturbation terms
other than J2 effect. The J2 effect can be switched on/off in the code.

Simulate only one initial condition
===================================
Run simSatellite.m

Simulate a bunch of initial conditions
======================================
Run simSatelliteMC.m

This will be particularly useful for particle based algorithms such as 
SMC/SIS.

In the code, uncertainty is only assumed in normalized (r,th) and sampled 
over uniform distribution with some interval. This can be easily extended 
to Gaussian. Care must be take to avoid unrealistic samples for normalized
variable r.

The code finally plots 6 polar plots (r,th) which shows the quick growth in
the uncertainty in the angular variable th.

Our objective is to mitigate the growth and estimate the angular position
with accuracy < 1%. This has to be achieved with large sensing gaps  and 
larger sensor noise.
